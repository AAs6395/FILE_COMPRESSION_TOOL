## ✨ Features

- **Lossless Compression**: Original data is perfectly preserved
- **Huffman Coding Algorithm**: Efficient variable-length encoding
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive design with drag-and-drop support
- **Multiple File Types**: Supports TXT, LOG, CSV, JSON, XML, HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Java, C, C++, Markdown
- **Fast Processing**: Quick compression and decompression
- **Secure**: Files are processed locally and not stored permanently
- **Real-time Feedback**: Progress indicators and error handling

## 🎯 How It Works

### Huffman Coding Algorithm

Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that:

1. **Analyzes character frequency** in the input text
2. **Builds a binary tree** where frequent characters have shorter codes
3. **Generates unique binary codes** for each character
4. **Encodes the text** using these variable-length codes
5. **Saves space** by using fewer bits for common characters

### Example

```
Original text: "AAABBC"
Character frequencies: A=3, B=2, C=1

Huffman codes might be:
A -> 0
B -> 10
C -> 11

Encoded: "000101011" (9 bits vs 48 bits in ASCII)
Compression ratio: ~81% reduction
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-compression-tool.git
   cd file-compression-tool
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open in browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## 💻 Usage

### Compressing Files

1. Navigate to the **Compress** page
2. Click the upload area or drag and drop a text file
3. Supported formats: `.txt`, `.log`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, `.py`, `.java`, `.cpp`, `.c`, `.md`
4. Click **Compress File**
5. Download the `.huff` compressed file

### Decompressing Files

1. Navigate to the **Decompress** page
2. Upload a `.huff` file (previously compressed by this tool)
3. Click **Decompress File**
4. Download the restored original text file

## 🎨 UI Features

- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Eye-catching color schemes
- **Drag & Drop**: Easy file upload
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback during processing
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Smooth Animations**: Professional transitions and effects
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and validation

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### `GET /`
Home page with navigation

### `GET /compress`
Compression interface

### `POST /compress`
- **Input**: Multipart form data with file
- **Output**: Compressed `.huff` file download
- **Errors**: 400 (invalid file), 500 (processing error)

### `GET /decompress`
Decompression interface

### `POST /decompress`
- **Input**: Multipart form data with `.huff` file
- **Output**: Decompressed `.txt` file download
- **Errors**: 400 (invalid file), 500 (processing error)

## 📊 Performance

### Compression Ratios (Typical)

| File Type | Average Compression |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Plain Text | 40-60% |
| Source Code | 50-70% |
| JSON | 60-80% |
| Logs | 50-70% |

*Note: Actual compression depends on character frequency distribution*

### Limitations

- Best suited for text-based files
- Small files (< 100 bytes) may not compress well
- Binary files are not supported
- Very random data compresses poorly

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Algorithm Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) for building tree, O(n) for encoding
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for tree storage

### File Format

Compressed `.huff` files contain:
1. Padding information (1 byte)
2. Pickled Huffman code dictionary
3. Compressed binary data

## 🔐 Security

- Files are processed server-side temporarily
- Original uploads are deleted after processing
- No permanent storage of user files
- No tracking or analytics

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error: "Cannot compress empty file"**
- Ensure the file contains text data

**Error: "Invalid file type"**
- Check that file extension is in the supported list

**Decompression fails**
- Ensure the file was compressed by this tool
- File may be corrupted

**Port already in use**
```bash
# Change port in app.py
app.run(debug=True, port=5001)
```
